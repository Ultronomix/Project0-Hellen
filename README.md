# Project0-Hellen
This project is about a shopping app, clothes in particular. I used the scanner object to get user input and switch statements to enable clients select outfits of their choice. There's also a generateBill method which is used to calculate the cost of the outputs selected by the customer. I also set up a database which i used to get selling price. cost price and profit from each item. My project is connected to the database using th JDBC driver.
